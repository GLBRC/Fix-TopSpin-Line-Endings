# Fix-TopSpin-Line-Endings

This repo contains a script and application for converting the line endings of certain Top Spin files from Unix format to Windows format.

The script should work on most unix/linux/mac systems.

A [Platpus](https://sveinbjorn.org/platypus) based Mac application is available under 'Releases'. This version supports dragging and dropping a folder onto the app to convert it.
